                   <h3><u>ANXIETY DISORDERS</u></h3>
                    <p>

                        Anxiety is a normal emotion. It’s your brain’s way of reacting to stress and alerting you of
                        potential danger ahead.

                        Everyone feels anxious now and then. For example, you may worry when faced with a problem at
                        work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision.

                        Occasional anxiety is OK. But anxiety disorders are different. They’re a group of mental
                        illnesses that cause constant and overwhelming anxiety and fear. The excessive anxiety can make
                        you avoid work, school, family get-togethers, and other social situations that might trigger or
                        worsen your symptoms.

                        With treatment, many people with anxiety disorders can manage their feelings.
                        The main symptom of anxiety disorders is excessive fear or worry. Anxiety disorders can also
                        make it hard to breathe, sleep, stay still, and concentrate. Your specific symptoms depend on
                        the type of anxiety disorder you have. <img src="assets/img/anxiety-disorder - Copy.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"></p>
                    <h3><u>MOOD DISORDERS</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        A mood disorder is a mental health problem that primarily affects a person’s emotional state. It
                        is a disorder in which a person experiences long periods of extreme happiness, extreme sadness,
                        or both.

                        It is normal for someone’s mood to change, depending on the situation. However, to be diagnosed
                        with a mood disorder, symptoms must be present for several weeks or longer. Mood disorders can
                        cause changes in your behavior and can affect your ability to deal with routine activities, such
                        as work or school.Two of the most common mood disorders are depression and bipolar disorder.Mood
                        disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder may recur or be ongoing and therefore may
                        require long-term or lifetime treatment. It is important to take your medications as
                        prescribed.<br>Seek help immediately if you feel suicidal or have thoughts of harming yourself
                        or others.<img src="assets/img/mood-disorder.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"></p>
                    <h3><u>SCHIZOPHRENIA</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally.
                        Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely
                        disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.

                        People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. Early treatment may help get symptoms
                        under control before serious complications develop and may help improve the long-term outlook.
                        Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions.
                        Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized
                        speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function.Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common
                        among people with schizophrenia. <br>If you have a loved one who is in danger of attempting
                        suicide
                        or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person.

                    <h3><u>DEMENTIA</u></h3>
                    <p style="margin-right: 230px;">
                        Dementia is a collective term used to describe various symptoms of cognitive decline, such as
                        forgetfulness. It is a symptom of several underlying diseases and brain disorders.

                        Dementia is not a single disease in itself, but a general term to describe symptoms of
                        impairment in memory, communication, and thinking.

                        While the likelihood of having dementia increases with age, it is not a normal part of
                        aging.A person with dementia may show any of the symptoms listed below, mostly due to memory
                        loss.
                        .<img src="assets/img/types-of-dementia-1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li><b>Recent memory loss – </b>a sign of this might be asking the same question repeatedly
                                ></li>
                        <li><b>Difficulty completing familiar tasks – </b>for example, making a drink or cooking a meal.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>Problems communicating –</b> difficulty with language; forgetting simple words or using
                            the wrong ones.</li>
                        <li><b>Disorientation –</b> getting lost on a previously familiar street, for example.</li>
                        <li><b> Problems with abstract thinking –</b> for instance, dealing with money.</li>
                        <li><b>Misplacing things – </b>forgetting the location of everyday items such as keys, or
                            wallets, for example.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3><u>EATING DISORDERS</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        Eating disorders are real, complex medical and psychiatric illnesses that can have serious
                        consequences for health, productivity and relationships.

                        Eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and OSFED
                        (other specified feeding or eating disorder), are bio-psycho-social diseases-- not fads, phases
                        or lifestyle choices.

                        People struggling with an eating disorder often become obsessed with food, body image and/or
                        weight. These disorders can be life-threatening if not recognized and treated appropriate.Eating
                        disorders are treatable, and earlier diagnosis and intervention often leads to better outcomes.
                        The most effective and long-lasting treatment for an eating disorder is some form of
                        psychotherapy or counseling, coupled with careful attention to medical and nutritional needs.
                        Ideally, whatever treatment is offered should be tailored to the individual; this will vary
                        according to both the severity of the disorder and the patient's individual problems, needs and
                        strengths.

                        Treatment must address the eating disorder symptoms and medical consequences, as well as
                        psychological, biological, interpersonal and cultural forces that contribute to or maintain the
                        eating disorder. <img src="assets/img/eating-disorders - Copy.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"></p>
                    <h3><u>PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        Psychotic disorders are a group of serious illnesses that affect the mind. They make it hard for
                        someone to think clearly, make good judgments, respond emotionally, communicate effectively,
                        understand reality, and behave appropriately.

                        When symptoms are severe, people with psychotic disorders have trouble staying in touch with
                        reality and often are unable to handle daily life. But even severe psychotic disorders usually
                        can be treated.<br>Doctors don't know the exact cause of psychotic disorders. Researchers
                        believe that many things play a role. Some psychotic disorders tend to run in families, which
                        means that the disorder may be partly inherited. Other things may also influence their
                        development, including stress, drug abuse, and major life changes.<img
