                    <p>When we fall or get injured, it’s only natural to immediately ask for help because it hurts and
                        we want to feel better. However, if some is struggling with internal pain, has loneliness,
                        depression, anxiety, isolation, or hopelessness, or someone perceives others are judging them
                        due to their mental illness, many people hesitate to ask for help in the same way they would for
                        a physical injury.

                        Unfortunately, this is the case for many who suffer from a mental illness, such as anxiety,
                        PTSD, depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or schizophrenia. There are
                        many reasons people keep their feelings quiet and don’t ask for help. Some examples are when
                        people worry about what others may think of them or worry, they will be judged by their mental
                        illness, or struggle with unhelpful thoughts such as “asking for help is a weakness.” Perhaps
                        people believe seeking help shows there is something wrong with them. Messages people receive
                        from others, the media, their culture, society, and from themselves often cause much worry and
                        anxiety and can hinder recovery and seeking help. </p>

                <div class="wow fadeInDown">
                    <h3><u>YOGA</u></h3>
                    <img src="assets/img/yoga.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>

                        It moves you from the sympathetic nervous system to the parasympathetic nervous system, or from
                        flight-or-flight to rest-and-digest. You typically have less anxiety and enter a more relaxed
                        state. As soon as you start breathing deeply, you slow down out of fight-or-flight and calm your
                        nervous system.

                        It helps you build your sense of self. Through yoga, you get to know yourself and cultivate a
                        more nonjudgmental relationship with yourself. You are building self-trust. You exercise more
                        and eat healthier, because your unconscious mind tells you, “I’m worthy of this me time, this
                        effort.” At the end of the day, everything comes down to your relationship with yourself. When
                        you get more confident and become more rooted in your sense of self and your center, you develop
                        a healthy, balanced ego, where you have nothing to prove and nothing to hide. You become
                        courageous, with high willpower. You’re not afraid of difficult conversations—you know you’re
                        still going to be OK at the end of the day.<br>


                        It helps you become aware of your “shadow” qualities. The yoking of solar and lunar (light
                        and dark) in yoga makes us recognize qualities in ourselves that we were not aware of, helping
                        us be more mindful. A lot of my work centers on the shadow concept from Carl Jung. How do we
                        look at those places in our bodies where we hold tension, tightness, knots of energy? That’s
                        typically where we are holding our psychological or emotional energy. We work from the outside
                        in, so asana is so important. A backbend will open your heart and release the stiffness between
                        the shoulder blades—at some point, you will have some sort of emotional release, which you may
                        or may not be conscious of. It’s about doing the inner work to shift or change and be open to
                        doing your best with your weaknesses and faults.</p>
                    <h3><u>MEDITATION</u></h3>
                    <img src="assets/img/meditation - Copy.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>
                        Since time immemorial, meditation has been used to attain enlightenment. Wise ones have touted
                        it as a means to get rid of misery. Experiences and modern research show that meditation is
                        helpful for life goals as regular and diverse as overcoming a traumatic heartbreak to increasing
                        daily productivity. Modern day meditators call it the food for the soul and suggest that the
                        practice can unlock doors to a better life.<br>Research has shown benefits of meditation towards
                        mental health. It helps relieve stress, reduce anxiety, increase kindness, improve
                        self-awareness and self-esteem.If stress has you anxious, tense and worried, consider trying
                        meditation. Spending even a few minutes in meditation can restore your calm and inner peace.<br>

                        Anyone can practice meditation. It's simple and inexpensive, and it doesn't require any special
                        equipment.

                        And you can practice meditation wherever you are — whether you're out for a walk, riding the
                        bus, waiting at the doctor's office or even in the middle of a difficult business meeting. </p>
                    <h3><u>MEDICATION</u></h3>
                    <img src="assets/img/medication - Copy.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>
                        There are several different types of drugs available to treat mental illnesses. Some of the most
                        commonly used are antidepressants, anti-anxiety, antipsychotic, mood stabilizing, and stimulant
                        medications.<br>When treating depression, several drug options are available.Your healthcare
                        provider can determine which medication is right for you. Remember that medications usually take
                        4 to 6 weeks to become fully effective. And if one drug does not work, there are many others to
                        try.In some cases, a combination of antidepressants sometimes called augmentation, may be
                        necessary. Sometimes an antidepressant combined with a different type of drug, such as a mood
                        stabilizer (like Lithium), a second antidepressant, or atypical anti-psychotic drug, is the most
                        effective treatment.

                        Side effects vary, depending on what type of drug you are taking, and may improve once your body
                        adjusts to the medication.
                    </p>
                    <h3><u>EDUCATE YOUSELF AND OTHERS</u></h3>
                    <img src="assets/img/educate - Copy.jpg" alt=""class="img-fluid">
                    <p>
                        Knowledge is power. Educate yourself (from reputable sources) about mental illness, symptoms and
                        treatments. Being informed is the first step in getting the proper treatment one needs for
                        emotional wellness.

                        In addition, educate others that mental illness is a physical disorder that can be treated just
                        as one would treat any other medical issue. Arm them with factual information to replace much of
                        the rumors or inaccuracies surrounding mental illness.

                        You (or your loved ones) can also talk openly about the illness and daily struggles with safe
                        and supportive people. Telling supportive persons about one’s recovery process will help people
                        to understand the challenges others faces. When people truly understand what mental illness is,
                        they are more likely to move past their negative views. Remember to avoid expecting people to
                        understand right away. Stigma takes time to overcome. Be gentle with yourself and others in this
                        process. Family therapy may also be helpful and be a neutral place to discuss barriers and
                        obstacles.


                    </p>
                    <h3><u>JOIN A SUPPORT GROUP</u></h3>
                    <img src="assets/img/Support.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>
                        Don’t isolate. If people don’t tell anyone about their struggles with mental illness, no one can
                        help them. There are many local and national support groups that offer programs and resources.
                        In addition, these groups are working hard to educate people with mental illnesses, their
                        families, their supportive persons and their communities to help reduce stigma and move toward
                        empowerment and recovery.
                        The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (if it
                        applies), are great places to start, and both are reputable resources. Check your county to see
                        what programing is offered. Often there are online groups and online resources for those
                        diagnosed with mental illnesses, along with resources and groups for their supportive persons.
                    </p>
                    <h3><u>SPEAK-UP AGAINST STIGMA</u></h3>
                    <img src="assets/img/speak.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>
                        Whether it’s with a group of friends or in front of a large audience, express your opinions in
                        an assertive and confident manner. Educate others respectfully about mental illness, to help
                        promote change. Remind people that they wouldn’t make fun of someone suffering from heart
                        disease, diabetes or cancer. Making fun of someone with mental illness is harmful, and only
                        increases stigma, and promotes discrimination. Speaking up will not only educate the public and
                        help reduce stigma, but it could also give courage to others facing a similar challenge, and
                        help them to seek help. Remember self-care during this process is vital. You are not alone; you
                        do not have to fight every battle. Reach out for help, and remember: self-compassion and
                        self-care is a gift we all need to open daily.</p>
